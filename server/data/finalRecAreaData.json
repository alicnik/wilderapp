The ocean played an important part of the Bokeya life. Fish , shellfish, sea mammals, and seaweed were gathered from the ocean and coast for food. From the land, vegetables, berries, roots and greens were gathered and mammals and birds hunted. The Bokeya traded items from the coast for acorns, buckeye, and pine nuts found further inland. <p>\r\nDuring the late 1800s, the town of Flumeville or Rollerville was located roughly at the intersection of Lighthouse Rd. and Highway 1. This small settlement helped move timber from the interior forests via the Garcia River with a system of flumes (trough-like channels filled with water), a narrow gauge railroad, and chute to sailing ships at Point Arena Harbor. <p>\r\nCattle troughs, a milk barn, and road system from the early 1900s remain as evidence of dairy operations. Joseph Sheppard established a Jersey dairy farm on portions of this area in the late 1800s. Around 1924, A.O. Stornetta purchased the ranch from the widow of Joseph Sheppard. Stornetta was known for combining local dairy operations. <p>\r\n<b>Point Arena Lighthouse Tower—1870</b><p>\r\nThe original lighthouse tower in the year it was opened. Constructed of brick and mortar in 1869, the tower housed a First Order Fresnel Lens. The tower was 100 feet tall. The great earthquake of 1906 damaged the lighthouse beyond repair and destroyed the lens. It is speculated that the spiral staircase prevented the tower from collapsing. The original staircase is still in use today inside the second tower. <p>\r\n<h2>Wildlife</h2> <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/blmcalifornia/28551506780/in/photolist-kUXiYL-qeLEyd-bcfwrx-qwatev-kUVEAx-eocNCi-ep91G3-ep91W1-bcfnCx-bcf9Hc-bcf9Hr-bcf9Hn-bcfnCZ-bcfnD2-28qyb1K-Rzsq6o-QSyxzQ-QSyptu-QV4r3a-QSykCJ-RY7dDi-RY7bw2-QV4jek-RzrXxo-QV4eP8-QV46xi-S6tFkW-RzrD3Y-Sa3z5z-QSxGkh-RzruHG-KTkRZN-KW6DYn-KW6C8D-KuZWfh-KuZUym-RzryDN-JZLQ1X-KTkRj9-KW6yte-KuZREq-KW6vvF-KuZPdS-KuZMMq-KuZKNf-KuZEs5-KuZCBS-KuZC1S-JZLxNg-JZL5Ne\" title=\"Point Arena-Stornetta unit of the California Coastal National Monument\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/28551506780_8826eaf002_n.jpg\" width=\"245\" height=\"320\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Point Arena-Stornetta unit of the California Coastal National Monument\"></a><InvalidTag async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The Unit is home to nine special status species, including plants, mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects.

Please contact the Monument for ticket prices and availability, either through their <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/tica/index.htm\" onclick=\"return confirm('You are now leaving this National Forest Web Site.')\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> or by calling the Visitor Center at 801-756-5238 (mid-May through October).</p>\r\r<h3>Cave Management</h3>\r\r<p>The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 provides direction for management of caves deemed significant due to characteristics that are geological, mineralogic, paleontologic, recreational, cultural, biotic, educational, and/or of scientific value. There are 69 caves on the Uinta National Forest that meet the criteria of the Act. Any management activities that could affect any known cave are restricted.</p>\r\r<h3>Logan Cave</h3>\r\r<p>The cave is gated closed.  The cave was closed to the public on October 1, 1997 to ensure the viability of a rare and special biological community of Townsend's Big-Eared Bats that is located in Logan Cave.  The bats are particularly vulnerable to human disturbance during their periods of mating, hibernation, and maternity colony, which runs from about October to August each year.  The Big-Eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species by both the Forest Service and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.  To aid with protecting this species during their vulnerable period, it is prohibited to into or within 250 feet of the mouth of Logan Cave.</p>\r\r<p> </p>","RecAreaPhone":"{}","RecAreaEmail":"uwc_info@fs.fed.us","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-111.165422,"RecAreaLatitude":40.614611,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"","address2":"","city":"","state":"WY","media":[{"title":"Uinta-Wsatch-Cache National Forest","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/08/21/02/26/1035_b03e33e5-ccfe-445c-86ba-041af761fe84_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Uinta-Wsatch-Cache National Forest","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/08/21/02/26/1035_c1bf925c-f64d-4f0a-a664-9a8b29ff9fc2_700.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.fs.usda.gov/uwcnf"},{"RecAreaID":"1036","RecAreaName":"Bridger-Teton National Forest","RecAreaDescription":"<p>Whether you are a new visitor to the Bridger-Teton National Forest or a local devotee already, this <em>Recreation</em> section of our website offers detailed information on the many recreation opportunities this Forest has to offer.  With  3.4 million acres of land and water to recreate in the possibilities are endless and exploring the Forest will last a lifetime. </p>\r\r<p>When it comes to recreation, the Bridger-Teton National Forest is known for the four W’s - Wildlife, Winter opportunities, Wilderness, and Wild and Scenic Rivers.  </p>\r\r<p>We invite you to explore, relax, and to soak in the beauty and awe that make the Bridger-Teton National Forest the amazing and unique place we love.</p>\r\r<p><strong>The easiest way to search for Recreation Activities on the Bridger-Teton National Forest is to s</strong><strong>elect the Ranger District you wish to visit from the list below.  Each Ranger District's recreation page has more detailed information about the various recreation areas and activities within their District.  For a map of the Forest click <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5340470.pdf\">here</a>.</strong></p>\r\r<p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71399\">Kemmere</a>r Ranger District<br/>\r<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71391\">Big Piney</a> Ranger District<br/>\r<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71395\">Greys River</a> Ranger District<br/>\r<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71397\">Jackson</a> Ranger District<br/>\r<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71393\">Blackrock</a> Ranger District<br/>\r<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=71401\">Pinedale</a> Ranger District</p>\r\r<p>Other areas of specific interest on the Forest include:</p>\r\r<ul>\r\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/btnf/?cid=STELPRDB5343268\">Wilderness Areas</a></li>\r\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/btnf/specialplaces/?cid=stelprdb5281115\">Wild and Scenic Rivers</a></li>\r\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/btnf/?cid=STELPRDB5341733\">Scenic Byways</a></li>\r\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recarea/?recid=77361\">Dispersed Camping</a></li>\r\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/btnf/?cid=STELPRD3837943\">Recreation Sites with facilities Accessible to the Disabled.</a></li>\r</ul>\r\r<p> </p>\r\r<p><a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/wps/PA_WIDContribution/simplegetfile?dDocName=STELPRD3845511&url=/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3845511.pdf\">\"Recreational Drone Tips\"</a>- Know where to Fly, Follow FAA Guidelines, Protect Wildlife and the Environment, Fly Safely (Stay in Control).

National Forest","RecAreaDescription":"Established in 1923, Allegheny National Forest (ANF) is Pennsylvania’s only National Forest. Situated in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains, the ANF is composed of plateau tops with elevations up to approximately 2,300 feet and valleys down to approximately 1,000 feet above sea level. The forest is approximately 517,000 acres and includes land in Elk, Forest, McKean and Warren counties in the northwestern corner of the state. The U.S. Forest Service brought new concepts in forest management to the Allegheny Plateau -- multiple benefits and sustainability. The motto \"Land of Many Uses\" captures the National Forest goal of a healthy, vigorous forest that provides wood products, watershed protection, a variety of wildlife habitats and recreational opportunities -- not only for us today, but in a sustainable way so future generations can enjoy these benefits, too.\nNo matter the season the Allegheny has your destination! Paddle down the Allegheny or Clarion Rivers, hike the North Country National Scenic Trail or ride on the miles of OHV and motorcycle trail. Looking for less human interaction? Check out Buzzard Swamp or any of our smaller campgrounds.","RecAreaPhone":"{}","RecAreaEmail":"sm.fs.anf@usda.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-79.244962,"RecAreaLatitude":41.5995763,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"","address2":"","city":"","state":"PA","media":[{"title":"Allegheny National Forest","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/02/17/06/1088_698b9ad8-9e67-417d-8e7c-2e6a318d06c8_700.jpg"},{"title":"Twin Lakes","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/33/1088_5b71428f-9d7e-4db9-b11b-2440ac49034c_700.jpg"},{"title":"Mead Run Ponds","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/30/1088_073e7d24-4696-40d5-bef2-bd71571bb596_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Rim Rock Overlook","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/31/1088_07338cb4-de98-4810-8397-61dfc730b901_700.jpg"},{"title":"Black Bear","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/28/1088_9b4e3236-6e1c-42c2-812f-f7955d1b26b4_700.jpg"},{"title":"Allegheny National Forest","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/02/17/06/1088_a996bb54-fa1a-4802-8143-9819e8328233_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Maple leaf with water drops","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/35/1088_5744cd74-140f-4f25-8338-d2dcc36bc12a_700.jpg"},{"title":"Hodgdon Meadow Campground","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/11/28/22/32/1088_0a887410-6df6-464b-b819-f2fab77c8f7c_700.jpg"},{"title":"Forest Pathway ","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/32/1088_4989835e-a193-4f50-8a5e-ba93ca62c604_700.jpg"},{"title":"Wild Turkeys on roadway","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/10/08/21/34/1088_b0851146-4d1b-4036-bba0-877f1dd380af_700.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.fs.usda.gov/allegheny"},{"RecAreaID":"1089","RecAreaName":"Green Mountain & Finger Lakes National Forests","RecAreaDescription":"<p><img alt=\"An expansive vista has green pines in the foreground looking over a valley framing a small lake.\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/fseprd574433.jpg\" style=\"width: 520px;

Beginning in low elevation grasslands and sagebrush, the forest steps up through forests of pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine to fir, spruce and aspen. Summer temperatures range from 50° F at night to 80-90° F during the day. Summer thunderstorms, known as the monsoon, can build up quickly, especially during July and August. Snow is common from December through March.</p>\n\n<p>Four designated wildernesses are managed for challenge and solitude. The Kaibab Plateau-North Rim Scenic Byway winds through meadows and forest ending at Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim.

Dispersed camping is the term used for camping anywhere in the National Forest outside of a designated campground. Dispersed camping means there are no toilets, no picnic tables, no trash cans, no treated water, and no fire grates. Typically, dispersed camping is not allowed in the immediate vicinity of developed recreation areas such as campgrounds, boat ramps, picnic areas or trailheads. There are extra responsibilities and skills that are necessary for dispersed camping.

Colonel William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody made the area now occupied by the Shoshone Project, famous in the early days of the West.  He and his companions were the first to perceive the possibilities of turning the sagebrush flats of Wyoming's Bighorn Basin into a land of agricultural abundance through irrigation. The main historic site is Buffalo Bill Dam, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a major engineering achievement.  A needle valve, ball valve, and a cableway winch once used at the dam are on display in the parking lot west of the dam.  Fishing open year-round. Wyoming State fishing license required. Fish species (coldwater) include rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout (mackinaw), and cutthroat trout. Good access via shoreline roads and 3 boat ramps.

The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The Refuge is a direct result of Dr. Carr bringing attention to the world's declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. This represents 25-35% of all loggerhead and green sea turtle nests in the US. It also serves as a minor nesting area for the leatherback turtle, which is one of the world's largest and rarest sea turtles. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 248-acre refuge is also unique for its placement within a patchwork of protected lands and among properties that have already been developed. To help preserve this globally important nesting ground the Service has established a partnership with State and County governments and private conservation groups to acquire and manage this dune habitat. The primary management thrust is to provide long term protection of this habitat for sea turtles and other listed species as well as providing compatible public use. Collaboratively, this partnership, known as the Archie Carr Working Group has protected over 900 acres and continues to educate thousands of residents and visitors about the unique characteristics of the barrier island ecosystem.","RecAreaPhone":"772-562-3909","RecAreaEmail":"archiecarr@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-80.4554,"RecAreaLatitude":27.8752,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"4055 Wildlife Way ","address2":"","city":"Vero Beach","state":"FL","media":[{"title":"Archie Car National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/02/11/53/1273_38a7444a-dab9-4183-a1ad-1f1f85df6a4d_700.jpg"},{"title":"Archie Car National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/02/11/53/1273_c919cefd-4ab1-4cbf-b74f-62ef524b1d7b_1440.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/archiecarr"},{"RecAreaID":"12730","RecAreaName":"National Aviation Heritage Area","RecAreaDescription":"Aviation is chock-full of tradition & history and nowhere will you find a richer collection of aviation than here, the birthplace of aviation.

Thirty-six species of fish occur in Arctic Refuge waters, and 180 species of birds have been observed on the refuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEight million acres of the Arctic Refuge are designated Wilderness, and three rivers (Sheenjek, Wind, and Ivishak) are designated Wild Rivers. Two areas of the refuge are designated Research Natural Areas. Because of distinctive scenic and scientific features, several rivers, valleys, canyons, lakes, and a rock mesa have been recommended as National Natural Landmarks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unique feature of the refuge is that large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes continue here, free of human control or manipulation. A prominent reason for establishment of the Arctic Refuge was the fact that this single protected area encompasses an unbroken continuum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems. Here, one can traverse the boreal forest of the Porcupine River plateau, wander north up the rolling tiaga uplands, cross the rugged, glacier-capped Brooks Range, and follow any number of rivers across the tundra coastal plain to the lagoons, estuaries, and barrier islands of the Beaufort Seas coast, all without encountering an artifact of civilization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge encompasses the traditional homelands and subsistence areas of Inupiaq Eskimos of the arctic coast and the Athabascan Indians of the interior.","RecAreaPhone":"907-456-0250 and 800-362-4546","RecAreaEmail":"arctic_refuge@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-147.706945,"RecAreaLatitude":64.838175,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"101 12th Ave., Room 236","address2":"","city":"Fairbanks","state":"AK","media":[{"title":"Arctic National Wildife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/74864.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/arctic/"},{"RecAreaID":"1278","RecAreaName":"Arthur R.

Scenic Wildlife Drive provides access along the southern edge of the Wilderness, where you can expect summer temperatures in the 90s and winter temperatures in the 70s. Humidity is almost always high, and afternoon rain showers are common in the summer. \r\nMosquitoes and no-see-ums can be abundant at times, especially in the summer. Other residents include alligators, raccoons, bobcats, river otters, and marsh rabbits. Creatures for whom the refuge was established include such migratory birds as ospreys, brown pelicans, moorhens, ducks, herons, egrets, anhingas, wood storks, and roseate spoonbills. Motorized boating is allowed in designated areas. Kayaking, canoeing, and sportfishing is allowed throughout the open water areas of the Wilderness. Public access is restricted in designated closed areas and bird rookeries. \r\n\r\n<p>Jay Norwood \"Ding\" Darling, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, helped pioneer the conservation movement, serving as head of the U.S. Biological Survey (forerunner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), creating the Federal Duck Stamp Program, starting the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit Program, and providing strong support for the expansion and administration of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Today, more than half of the 12-mile subtropical barrier island called Sanibel Island has been protected and bears witness to the legacy of the conservation visionary J.

Although the landscape of the Alaska Peninsula is de facto wilderness, this federally designated area has additional protections.\r\n\r\nThe Wilderness contains a broad diversity of habitats. The eastern boundary is the Pacific Ocean, lined with swathes of sandy beach, rocky coastline, and steep cliffs. Uplifted layers of fossil-bearing rock tilt into the sea, windswept and traced with the tracklines of brown bears. In summer, the cliffs are packed with thousands of murres and kittiwakes, their calls reverberating over the surf. The boundary on the north follows the knife-edged peaks of the Kejulik Mountains that separate the Refuge from Katmai National Park. These uplands shed meltwater from the winter snows into the Kejulik River and its valley, spurring vigorous growth of brush that provides shelter and food for moose.\r\n\r\nExtending almost to Whale Mountain to the west, the boundary line follows the shore of Becharof Lake, out to the end of the Severson Peninsula that divides Island Arm from the open water. Sockeye salmon mass in the streams well into the fall, drawing char and grayling, bears and cormorants. The flat tundra by the lake bears tiny wind-compressed blossoms in summer, and scattered berries later in the year. The southern boundary line crosses the Arm and the Aleutian Range, back to the coast at Cape Unalishagvak.\r\n\r\nA prominent point of land, formed by the actions of ancient glaciers, extends from the northern shore of Becharof Lake.  Near the end is a cluster of small cabins, built in 1967 as a Christian camp. These were incorporated into the Wilderness, and still see use today by anglers, hunters, pilots, students, Refuge staff, and other visitors. The Refuge stores emergency supplies and equipment at Bear Creek Camp to help those trapped by weather or other circumstances.","RecAreaPhone":"907-246-4250 or 907-246-3339","RecAreaEmail":"akpeninsula@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&latitude=57.865156365&longitude=-155.74591702&zoom=9","RecAreaLongitude":-156.6486,"RecAreaLatitude":58.6764,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"4 Bear Road","address2":"P.O.

In 1980 the Koyukuk Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. \r\n<p>Think of 3.5-million-acre Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge, and water comes to mind: there are 14 rivers, hundreds of meandering creeks, more than 15,000 lakes, all forming the floodplain of the Koyukuk River. The lands of the refuge are still of great importance to the Alaskans who live in villages within or adjacent to its boundaries. Local subsistence activities include gathering meat, fish and berries, trapping of furbearers, and cutting house logs and firewood. There are no roads and no maintained trails, but the lower Koyukuk River provides a \"highway\" through the heart of the refuge. \r\n<p>Moose are common within the refuge. Brown and black bears wade into the rivers in night-less summer to escape swarms of mosquitoes and other biting insects. Lynx, coyotes, red foxes, wolves, and wolverines might also be seen. Beavers abound, and thousands of migratory waterfowl nest and raise their young within the productive river basin. The rivers and wetlands are also habitat to salmon, sheefish, pike and grayling. \r\n\r\n<p>Four-hundred thousand acres of the Koyukuk Refuge are preserved as Wilderness. Miles of boreal forest surround a unique geological feature -- the Nogahabara Sand Dunes. The roughly circular active dune field spans about 6 miles in diameter, and was formed thousands of years ago when wind-blown glacial sand was deposited at the base of the Nulato Hills. The isolated dunes are lightly vegetated, and continue to shift with the wind. \r\n\r\n<p>The Three-Day Slough area also lies within the Koyukuk Wilderness and receives some public use, primarily by moose-hunters in the fall. Fishing and hunting are allowed throughout the Refuge, subject to State and Federal regulations. Visitors should be respectful of private in-holdings within the Refuge, and hunters are asked to maintain the Native tradition of using all parts of the gifts from nature. \r\n\r\n<p>The Koyukuk Wilderness, like the rest of the Koyukuk Refuge, is very remote. When planning a trip, be prepared for minimal human contact outside of the villages, and consider that weather and other situations can create conditions that are life-threatening. Enjoy and respect the challenge, discovery and freedom of wildlands. Make demands on yourself, not on the environment, and leave little or no trace of your presence.","RecAreaPhone":"800-656-1231 or (907)656-1231","RecAreaEmail":"r7kynwr@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&latitude=65.6511732881&longitude=-157.329312492&zoom=9","RecAreaLongitude":-156.927452,"RecAreaLatitude":64.73344,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"101 Front Street","address2":"P.O.

Several colonial bird species - great blue heron, black-crowned night-heron, herring gull, ring-billed gull, great black-backed gull, common tern, Caspian tern, and double-crested cormorant - nest on these islands in substantial numbers. Standing dead green ash trees are the main vegetation, with a lush understory of common elderberry, scattered red-osier dogwood, and an abundance of \"weedy\" plants. The death of the ash has been blamed on the extensive use by cormorants. In order to protect nesting birds, public visitation is prohibited.","RecAreaPhone":" 906/586-9851","RecAreaEmail":"seney@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&latitude=45.6940731383&longitude=-85.7518555046&zoom=14","RecAreaLongitude":-85.944638,"RecAreaLatitude":46.288695,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":" 1674 Refuge Entrance Road","address2":"","city":"Seney","state":"MI","media":[{"title":"Michigan Islands Wilderness","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/1046.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&WID=354"},{"RecAreaID":"12819","RecAreaName":"Mingo Wilderness","RecAreaDescription":"<p><br>The Mingo Wilderness now contains a total of 7,730 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service.

In 1976 the Mingo Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. \r\n<p>Eighteen thousand years ago, the Mississippi River flowed through this area on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. Because of natural events, the river shifted east forming a biologically rich swampland comprised of bottomland hardwoods intermixed with cypress and tupelo. The former channel basin attracted Native Americans who utilized the bountiful natural resources. By the late 1800’s, settlers and loggers started draining the swamp while removing large tracts of old-growth forest. In 1944, Congress authorized the purchase of the remnant forest lands to create the 21,592 acre Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. Today, Mingo Wilderness is a large fragment of this refuge. The wilderness provides critical food and shelter for bald eagles and migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Flyway. Giant cypress dominates the wilderness swamp offering nesting platforms for eagles and other birds. Otters and beaver, turkey and amphibians are frequent sightings for visitors. Predator-proof nesting boxes, used commonly by the evasive wood ducks, dot the refuge. \r\n<p>The western one-third of the refuge offers a wilderness setting with diverse habitat and abundant wildlife, an area highlighted with gentle rolling hills of the Ozark Plateau nestled beside Monopoly Marsh with intersecting streams and rich swamplands.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Minnesota. In 1976 the Tamarac Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. There is a special feeling of wildness about this place, Tamarac, best expressed by the eerie howl of a wolf, mournful wail of a loon, or the drumming of a ruffed grouse from deep within the forest. \r\n<p>Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge is located in the glacial lake country of northwestern Minnesota. It was established in 1938 as a refuge breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Tamarac is a land of rolling forested hills interspersed with lakes, rivers, marshes, bogs and shrub swamps. The token of the refuge is the Tamarack tree. This unusual tree is a deciduous conifer, turning brilliant gold before losing its needles each fall. Tamarac’s wilderness consists of four sections of the 42,738- acre refuge: three islands in Tamarac Lake (totaling 65 acres in the southwest section) and the 2000 acre northwest corner. Here you will find stands of mature white pines, a favorite nesting tree of bald eagles. \r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the refuge was a prized hunting, fishing, ricing and maple sugaring area for Native American tribes. The Sioux once controlled the area followed by the Ojibwe. Today the northern half of the refuge lies within the original White Earth Indian Reservation established in 1867. Tribal members continue to hunt, fish, trap and harvest herbs, berries and wild rice on the refuge. \r\n\r\n<p>Tamarac lies in the heart of one of the most diverse transition zones in North America, where northern hardwood, coniferous forests and the tall grass prairie converge. This diversity of habitat brings with it a wealth of wildlife. There are over 250 species of birds and 50 species of mammals. Spring on the refuge attracts a magnificent warbler migration and fall is highlighted with an abundance of waterfowl including more than 15,000 ring-necked ducks at its peak. Bald eagles are common and wolves are occasionally seen. Tamarac is one of the premier production areas for trumpeter swans in the lower 48 states. The refuge also provides critical nesting habitat for golden-winged warblers, a Species of Concern whose population has declined steadily over the past 35 years due to loss of habitat. Other wildlife include black bear, porcupine, mink, fisher, otter and beaver. \r\n\r\n<p>The northwest wilderness area is part of the sanctuary which is open September-February.The wilderness does not have established hiking trails and overnight camping is prohibited. \r\n\r\n<p>With the brilliant fall colors of aspen, maple, oak, birch and tamarack interspersed with evergreens, Autumn truly is a beautiful time to experience the wilderness of Tamarac.","RecAreaPhone":"218-847-2641","RecAreaEmail":"tamarac@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&latitude=47.0682&longitude=-95.598741&zoom=13","RecAreaLongitude":-95.654751,"RecAreaLatitude":46.957924,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"35704 County Hwy 26","address2":"","city":"Rochert","state":"MN","media":[{"title":"","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/08/09/20/56/5458e5ef-1643-490e-b06f-01db73e0006d_450.jpg"},{"title":"Tamarac Wilderness","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/1077.jpg"},{"title":"B6","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/08/09/20/55/20deea63-980d-4c98-83d4-1236177b95e7_450.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&WID=593"},{"RecAreaID":"12838","RecAreaName":"Togiak Wilderness","RecAreaDescription":"<p><br>The Togiak Wilderness now contains a total of 2,274,066 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service's a, href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/togiak/\">Togiak National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

Habitats include barrier island beach and dunes, shrub-scrub, woodlands, farm land and freshwater marsh. Since 1939, 4,600 acres of Back Bay waters, surrounding the original Refuge lands, have been closed to migratory bird hunting by Presidential Proclamation. Today, the Refuge continues to be an important link in the chain of national wildlife refuges along the Atlantic Flyway. More than 300 species of birds have been observed at the Refuge. During the fall and winter months, large flocks of waterfowl use the Bay and freshwater impoundments. The snow and Canada goose, tundra swan, and many duck species are abundant. Migrating songbirds and shorebirds arrive at the Refuge each spring and fall. Brightly colored warblers dot shrub and woodland areas while shorebirds search for food in shallow waters. Habitats are also used by a wide assortment of other wildlife, including such threatened and endangered species as the loggerhead sea turtle.","RecAreaPhone":"757-301-7329","RecAreaEmail":"erica_ryder@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-75.98488,"RecAreaLatitude":36.73255,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"(Physical address)","address2":"4005 Sandpiper Road","city":"Virginia Beach","state":"VA","media":[{"title":"Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/79010.jpg"},{"title":"Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/03/14/28/1284_549a11ba-5646-4594-8949-8ad5449e715c_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/03/14/28/1284_2ee50b89-5d5b-4911-a64f-e3facd8dbc76_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/back_bay/"},{"RecAreaID":"12840","RecAreaName":"UL Bend Wilderness","RecAreaDescription":"<p><br>The UL Bend Wilderness now contains a total of 20,819 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service's <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Charles_M_Russell/\">Charles M.

Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase.\r\n\r\n<p>White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chitto's majestic habitat.  \r\n\r\n<p>Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.

The South Carolina State Commission of Forestry also conducted timber production and harvesting as long as these activities conformed to good game management and forestry practices.  Over the years, management objectives have since been added and modified under other authorities.  The 45,348-acre refuge now serves as a demonstration site for land management practices, which preserve and enhance the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina Sandhills NWR is situated along the fall line separating the Atlantic Coastal Plain and the Piedmont Plateau in what is known as the Sandhills Region of South Carolina.  Due to its location, the refuge is home to a variety of plants, animals, and habitat types characteristic of both the coastal plain and Piedmont Plateau. Rolling sandhills and deep sandy soils found here are remnants of an ancient coastal shoreline of what is now known as the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge supports approximately 190 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 41 species of reptiles, 25 species of amphibians, and innumerable species of plants.  Among this diverse group of fauna and flora are several species that are listed as threatened or endangered.  These include the Swainson's warbler, red-cockaded woodpecker, pine barrens treefrog, white wicky, Well's pixie moss, and the sweet pitcher plant.  Thirty man-made lakes & ponds & over 1,200 acres of fallow fields, forest openings, & cultivated fields contribute to the diverse habitat found here.

The 6,671 acre Headquarters Unit borders nine miles of the northeast shore of Catahoula Lake, a 26,000 acre natural wetland renowned for its large concentrations of migratory waterfowl.  The 18,491 acre Bushley Bayou Unit, located 8 miles west of Jonesville, was established May 16, 2001.  This acquisition was made possible through a partnership agreement between The Conservation Fund, American Electric Power, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The habitat found at the refuge is primarily lowland hardwood forest subject to seasonal backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers.\r\n<p>White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge.  Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat.  Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation.  In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area.  Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site):  a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl.

The Refuge's namesake famously portrayed the rich diversity of native wildlife and habitats of the area in many of his paintings. \r\n<p>UL Bend NWR, a \"refuge-within-a-refuge,\" lies within Charles M. Russell NWR and contains 20,000 acres of designated wilderness. The Refuge complex also contains Hailstone, Halfbreed, Lake Mason, and War Horse NWRs. These small satellite refuges are scattered throughout central Montana and were established primarily to protect wetlands for migratory birds and waterfowl. Several waterfowl production areas are also managed as part of the Refuge complex. \r\n<p>Hunting and fishing opportunities abound on Charles M. Russell NWR, its satellite refuges, and the waterfowl production areas. Boating is popular on the Missouri River and Fort Peck Reservoir. Several state parks and recreational areas have been developed within the Refuge. Each fall, hundreds of elk congregate in the Slippery Ann Wildlife Viewing Area, creating a spectacle not to be missed. Camping is permitted anywhere on the Refuge. The entire Refuge is open to hiking and horseback riding although no formal trails exist. Excellent wildlife viewing and photography opportunities are found throughout the Refuge.","RecAreaPhone":"406-538-8706","RecAreaEmail":"cmr@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-109.442317,"RecAreaLatitude":47.051451,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Airport Road","address2":"","city":"Lewistown","state":"MT","media":[{"title":"Charles M.

The Divisions were combined in 1984 under the Edwin B. Forsythe\r\n\r\nname, in honor of the late conservationist Congressman from New Jersey.  The refuge complex covers approximately 46,000 acres in three counties including Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly 80 percent of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt meadow and marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Most of the remainder of the refuge acreage is woodlands dominated by pitch pines, oaks, and white cedar, with some fields which are maintained to provide habitat diversity.  More than 6,000 acres are designated as Wilderness Area. This includes Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier\r\n\r\nbeaches in New Jersey. These pristine sites provide critical nesting habitat for threatened piping plovers and a wide variety of other beachnesting species. Beaches and dunes provide nesting habitat for piping plovers, black skimmers and least terns. Occasionally peregrine falcons, bald eagles and osprey are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach spring and fall, thousands of water birds stop at Forsythe Refuge during their long migrations.

Conservation of fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity is a focus of the refuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInnoko National Wildlife Refuge can be roughly divided into two distinct habitat types. Approximately half of the refuge consists of black spruce muskeg, wet meadows, and sedge or horsetail marshes, set with innumerable lakes and ponds of varying size. The rest of the terrain is marked by hills, most of which are less than one thousand feet in elevation. The refuge covers some 3,850,000 acres, with its 1,240,000 acres of designated Wilderness found in the south-east, bordered by the Innoko River on its western boundary and including portions of the Iditarod and Big and Little Yetna Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the extensive wetlands contained within the refuge, it's not surprising that Innoko is blessed with a wealth of avian life. It's estimated that 130 species of birds use these lands, and that more than 300,000 waterfowl and shorebirds nest on the refuge every spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequent flooding of Innoko's many rivers and streams helps fertilize surrounding soils and maintain the rich willow sandbar habitat that provides winter food for the refuge's moose population, as well as for the beaver that are common along virtually all of Innoko's waterways. Barren ground caribou from the Beaver Mountain herd winter on Innoko when deep snows move them down from the uplands, while both black and grizzly bear and wolves are present year around.

Together, the State and the Service have been able to develop large complexes of habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife species. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Wetland Management District encompasses 35 counties, at this date, there are WPAs in 16\r\n\r\ncounties. Most acquisitions are intended to increase habitat at existing wetland complexes, so it is unlikely that tracts\r\n\r\nwill be acquired in the entire 35-county area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost WPAs are small, from 100 to 500 acres, but several have\r\n\r\ngrown considerably. Union Hills WPA in Cerro Gordo County is the largest in Iowa at over 2,000 acres.\r\n\r\nSpring Run, a large complex of State and Federal lands in Dickinson County, is the second largest WPA.\r\n\r\nDugout Creek WPA in Dickinson County and Lower Morse Lake in Wright County are also among the larger\r\n\r\nrestored tracts in the Iowa Wetland Management District.","RecAreaPhone":"515-928-2523 ","RecAreaEmail":"unionslough@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-94.110516,"RecAreaLatitude":43.283732,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"1710 360th St.","address2":"","city":"Titonka","state":"IA","media":[{"title":"LOOP C SITE 100","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/19/48/1436_bd3d3169-7b0b-4d36-b12c-7ca2ee27f1c8_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/iowa_wmd/"},{"RecAreaID":"1437","RecAreaName":"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge lies midway between Buffalo and Rochester, NY, within the Atlantic Flyway.

The mainland refuge unit, the Hunting Islands, and Price Island are in Washington. Tenasillahe Island, Wallace Island, and several parcels around Westport are in Oregon.The valuable habitat the refuge preserves for the deer also benefits a large variety of wintering birds, a small herd of Roosevelt elk, river otter, various reptiles and amphibians including painted turtles and red-legged frogs, and several pairs of nesting bald eagles and osprey.    The Columbian white-tailed deer is one of 30 subspecies of white-tailed deer in North America, and the only one found west of the Cascade Mountains. These deer once ranged throughout the river valleys west of the Cascade Mountains from the Umpqua River in Oregon, northward through the Willamette Valley to Puget Sound, and westward down the lower Columbia River.During the 1800s, deer numbers were dangerously low due to overhunting and loss of habitat. By the turn of the century, they had disappeared from nearly all of their range and, in the 1930s, were thought to be extinct. Remnant populations were discovered here and near Roseburg, Oregon.In 1968, the lower Columbia River population was listed as a federally endangered species because it was in imminent danger of becoming extinct. This population is now found only along the lower Columbia River between Skamokawa, Washington, and Clatskanie, Oregon.Today, about 300 of these deer live on the refuge. Another 300-400 live on private lands along the river. The areas upstream from the refuge on Puget Island and on the Oregon side of the river are vital to reestablishing and maintaining viable populations of the species. The refuge works with private and corporate landowners to maintain and reestablish deer on their lands.","RecAreaPhone":"360-484-3482","RecAreaEmail":"willapa@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-123.399879,"RecAreaLatitude":46.232534,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"C/O Willapa National Wildlife Refuge Complex","address2":"3888 State Route 101","city":"Ilwaco","state":"WA","media":[{"title":"C LOOP SITE 111","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/19/19/37/1447_388bcf71-34f8-48a7-8a6f-90a3bf270930_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/pacific/refuges/field/WA_julia.htm"},{"RecAreaID":"1448","RecAreaName":"Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge is, at 1.637 million acres, about the size of the state of Delaware. It sits atop the Arctic Circle, with approximately a third of the refuge above that meridian and two-thirds below. The refuge is a prime example of Alaska's boreal ecosystem, which is dominated by black and white spruce with some white birch and poplars. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region's typically short, hot summers give rise to numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes. This results in a continuous cycle of burn and recovery.  Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with different plant species, and levels of maturity within each species.  The resulting mosaic of habitat types supports a variety of wildlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge's migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its Sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species' population on record, while Kanuti's salmon travel more than 1000 miles up the Yukon before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside of Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge's boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including brown and black bears, several wolf packs, moose, wolverine, beavers, muskrats, marten and mink. Caribou from the Western Arctic and Ray Mountain herds occasionally winter on Kanuti, as well.","RecAreaPhone":"907-456-0329","RecAreaEmail":"kanuti_refuge@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-147.706945,"RecAreaLatitude":64.838175,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"101 12th Ave.  ","address2":"Room 206","city":"Fairbanks","state":"AK","media":[{"title":"C LOOP SITE 112","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/19/19/38/1448_a0fd0c03-f3bb-46ca-900f-344109e8c8fa_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/kanuti/"},{"RecAreaID":"14487","RecAreaName":"El Yunque National Forest","RecAreaDescription":"<!--<p>A visit to the El Yunque National Forest is a special experience.

Located along the south central coast of the island of Maui between the towns of Kihei and Ma'alaea, this 691-acre wetland is home to the endangered <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/pacific/pacificislands/wesa/coothi.html\">Hawaiian coot</a> (ae'o) and <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/pacific/pacificislands/wesa/coothi.html\">Hawaiian coot</a> ('alae ke oke'o).  The refuge is adjacent to Kealia Beach, which is a nesting ground for the endangered hawksbill turtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKealia Pond serves as a settling basin a 56-square mile watershed that results in seasonal intermittent flooding during winter months and dryer conditions during late summer months. This creates open water (200 acres) and shallow mud flat areas interspersed with vegetation, which provide suitable resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for endangered water birds. During certain times of the year, the refuge supports at least half of the Hawaiian stilt population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pond also supports a diverse assemblage of migratory birds from late summer (August) to early spring (April). It is one of the most important areas in the state for wintering migratory waterfowl. Migratory shorebirds also congregate here to take advantage of the food resources along the water's edge. As water recedes, fish are crowded into the remaining water, making them easy prey for 'auku'u (black-crowned night herons).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately 2,700 people visit the refuge each year to engage in various wildlife-oriented activities, including bird watching, photography, environmental education, habitat restoration projects that involve removal of exotic species, and outplanting with Hawaii's native vegetation.","RecAreaPhone":"808-875-1582","RecAreaEmail":"courtney_brown@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-156.46632,"RecAreaLatitude":20.7949134,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"C/O Maui Refuge Complex","address2":"Milepost 6, Mokulele Hwy (Hwy 311)","city":"Kihei","state":"HI","media":[{"title":"C LOOP SITE 113","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/19/19/39/1449_16d99d4a-1324-4763-b9d3-446086fc7dd6_700.jpg"},{"title":"Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/04/16/18/52/1449_735131b5-de19-4ff6-871d-e77745de2541_700.jpg"},{"title":"Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/04/16/18/50/1449_a077fe62-7e28-473b-993b-752f51415726_1440.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/kealia_pond/"},{"RecAreaID":"14490","RecAreaName":"Apalachicola National Forest","RecAreaDescription":"<p>The Apalachicola National Forest offers recreational opportunities for all interests.

Eager anglers can pursue chinook, sockeye, coho and pink salmon; as well as Dolly Varden char, rainbow trout, and arctic grayling. The refuge is also home to brown and black bears, caribou, Dall sheep, mountain goats, wolves, lynx, wolverines, eagles and thousands of shorebirds and waterfowl, not to mention the mighty Alaska-Yukon moose that the refuge was originally established (as the Kenai National Moose Range) to protect.\r\n<p>Today.

Established in 1941, the refuge provides habitat for brown bear, salmon and other wildlife.  Kodiak's scenery is magnificient- rugged mountains, hundreds of miles of shoreline, lakes, marshes, bogs, and meadows.  Four-thousand-foot mountains rise from the sea accented with fjordlike inlets.  Lush vegetation blankets the mountains ranging from sedges, alders, and spruce to colorful wildflowers and berries.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1.9 million-acre Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge roughly encompasses the southwestern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area on northwestern Afognak Island, and all of Ban Island.  No place on the refuge is more than 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean.  Without roads, the refuge provides a wilderness setting for fish, wildlife, and humans alike.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge is home to an estimated 2,300 brown bears, and at least 600 nesting pairs of bald eagles. More than 250 species of birds live upon or visit the refuge, while more than 1.5 million seabirds overwinter in nearshore waters surrounding Kodiak Island. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge also provides spawning and rearing habitat for all five North American species of Pacific salmon. Salmon produced on the refuge make up approximately 65% of the total commercial harvest in the Kodiak Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKodiak refuge offers superb recreational opportunities.  These include hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, rafting and camping. The refuge also maintains several remote public-use cabins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge headquarters and visitor center are located on Buskin River Road, five miles south of downtown Kodiak or 0.5 miles north of the State Airport.  Directional signs are posted in town and along Resauof Drive.  The center offers displays, videos of Kodiak, a small Alaska Natural History Association bookstore, and trip planning information.  In addition, refuge staff offer interpretive programs for visitors and assistance to schools and other groups interested in outdoor class room experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackcountry Basics:\r\n\r\nBe bear safe: keep a clean camp.

Rich in wetlands, the Northern Innoko is an extremely productive breeding area for migratory waterfowl and fish. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe streams and rivers of the refuge complex support three species of salmon, arctic grayling, sheefish, and many other fish species. Northern pike, especially those that winter in the shallow lakes of the Northern Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, sometimes grow to record size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Koyukuk's wetlands, breeding waterfowl feast upon water plants and abundant protein-rich invertebrates. Young birds grow quickly in the short, lush summer, and prepare for the fall migration. As many as 100,000 ducks are hatched and raised on Refuge lands during a single nesting season. Migratory songbirds and raptors also depend on the rich resources of the Koyukuk Refuge for breeding and raising young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKoyukuk Refuge's Three-Day Slough area, part of the 400,000 acre Koyukuk Wilderness, has some of the most productive moose habitat in Alaska. This region has, at times, supported more than 10 moose per square mile.  Recent counts indicate that some areas still contain densities of five moose or more per square mile. As with much of the refuge big game work, these moose counts are cooperative efforts between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaribou from the migratory Western Arctic Herd, which numbers more than 450,000, often move into the northernmost reaches of the Refuge in winter months in search of lichens that lie beneath the snow. The Koyukuk also supports a resident non-migratory caribou population, the Galena Mountain Herd, which numbers about 300.

The refuge was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood wilderness. Levees have changed hydrology, but the underlying ridge/Saale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present,\r\n\r\nthough less common. Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the\r\n\r\nrefuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and\r\n\r\ncatfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEndangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuge's three-year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common.","RecAreaPhone":"318-253-4238","RecAreaEmail":"lakeophelia@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-92.137944,"RecAreaLatitude":31.109388,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"401 Island Road","address2":"","city":"Marksville","state":"LA","media":[{"title":"D LOOP SITE 140","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/19/19/47/1476_07bd4712-8b64-4594-a68c-8f00536bd6a7_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/lake_ophelia/"},{"RecAreaID":"1478","RecAreaName":"Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Located in Coos County New Hampshire and  Oxford County Maine, Lake Umbagog refuge is a northern treasure in the National Wildlife Refuge System.

Three other units of Little Pend Oreille Refuge, including Cusick Flats (255 acres), Springdale (54 acres) and Kaniksu (716 acres), are managed from this station. More than 50,000 visitors enjoy the refuge each year. Hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, hiking, camping, and horseback riding are the most popular recreational activities.","RecAreaPhone":"509-684-8384","RecAreaEmail":"Ipo@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-117.732201,"RecAreaLatitude":48.461468,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"1310 Bear Creek Rd","address2":"","city":"Colville","state":"WA","media":[{"title":"Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/06/27/19/53/1486_64a5afe6-ac1a-48d5-bc2c-54ce3907313f_700.jpg"},{"title":"Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/06/27/19/52/1486_28038ec3-91cd-45ea-bc6d-206cc9c07be7_1440.jpg"},{"title":"D LOOP SITE 150","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/19/17/44/1486_861c1679-7330-4bb8-a621-f8344fb0eff0_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/little_pend_oreille/"},{"RecAreaID":"14882","RecAreaName":"California National Historic Trail - Nobles Emigrant segment","RecAreaDescription":"The Nobles Trail is a branch of the California National Historic Trail, located outside of Susanville, Ca.

The refuge, with a backdrop of 14,000-foot Mount Shasta to the southwest, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as both a National Historic Landmark and a National Natural Landmark. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 50,092-acre refuge is a varied mix of intensively managed shallow marshes, open water, grassy uplands, and croplands that provide feeding, resting, nesting, and brood-rearing habitat for waterfowl and other water birds. This refuge is one of the most biologically productive refuges within the Pacific Flyway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately 80 percent of the flyway's migrating waterfowl pass through the Klamath Basin on both spring and fall migrations, with 50 percent using the refuge. Peak waterfowl populations can reach 1.8 million birds, which represent 15 to 45 percent of the total birds wintering in California. The refuge produces between 30,000 and 60,000 waterfowl annually. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge is also a fall staging area for 20 to 30 percent of the central valley population of sandhill crane. From 20,000 to 100,000 shorebirds use refuge wetlands during the spring migration. Wintering wildlife populations include 500 bald eagle and 30,000 tundra swan. Spring and summer nesting wildlife include many colonial water birds, such as white-faced ibis, heron, egret, cormorant, grebe, white pelican, and gulls. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, the refuge provides habitat for 25 species of special concern listed as threatened or sensitive by California and Oregon. All refuge waters are delivered through a system of diversion or irrigation canals associated with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project. Consequently this leaves the refuge vulnerable to periodic water shortages due to an over-allocated system.","RecAreaPhone":"530-667-2231","RecAreaEmail":"r8kbwebmaster@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-121.557583,"RecAreaLatitude":41.972611,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"4009 Hill Rd","address2":"","city":"Tulelake","state":"CA","media":[{"title":"CAMPGROUND ENTRANCE","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/15/07/1493_6a81c032-044a-462d-af52-e9727e592cd1_700.jpg"},{"title":"LOOP A SITE 4","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/15/02/1493_991e2c60-936e-457b-b76a-7b028af70f2b_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/lower_klamath/"},{"RecAreaID":"1494","RecAreaName":"Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1979, is located along the southern edge of the Big Bend region of Florida's west coast, approximately 50 miles southwest of Gainsville. This 54,000 acre refuge is one of the largest undeveloped river delta - estuarine systems in the United States and was established to protect natural ecosystems of the Suwannee River's lower reaches and coastal marsh, as it empties into the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis diverse mixture of uplands, freshwater, saltwater and their associated wetlands, creates a great variety of wildlife habitat and scenic vistas. Osprey and bald eagle nest in early spring, while graceful swallow-tailed kites arrive in March for breeding and remain through July.  In March and April migrating shorebirds cover the oysterbars; thousands of knots, dowitchers, oystercatchers, sandpipers, turnstones, and plovers fatten up for their northward trip to their breeding grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWading birds are most abundant during the summer and they can be found feeding in the freshwater and salt marshes.  White ibis, great, snowy, and cattle egrets along with great blue, little blue, green, and tricolored herons are among the birds that roost and nest on nearby Cedar Keys refuge.  Rare Limpkins and endangered wood storks are occasionally seen prowling the water's edge during the warm months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlert boaters may see endangered Gulf Sturgeon jumping in the river.

Colonial nesting birds, river otters, and mink feed upon the large populations of cold- and warmwater fish that flourish in shallow beds of submerged vegetation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndisturbed habitats are critical to colonial nesting birds, especially American white pelican, and molting waterfowl; nowhere else in southeastern Idaho can such habitat be found in this quantity or quality. The refuge uplands are a mix of rock, sand, and shallow soil habitat that supports a diversity of small mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates. The basalt lava flows provide habitat for some of the more diverse reptile fauna in Idaho. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idaho dunes tiger beetle, a species of special concern, is found on refuge sand dunes, while the Utah valvata, an endangered snail, inhabits the reservoir.

This 13,000 acre plus wetland complex consists of seasonally flooded bottomland hardwood forests, impoundments, and croplands.  During the winter, a 4,000 acre greentree reservoir is created when the bottomland hardwood forests are allowed to flood.  This seasonally flooded area provides a haven for mallards, wood ducks, and other waterfowl species.\n\n\n\nThis refuge is a wetland complex within the watershed of Overflow Creek which flows southerly along the length of the refuge.  On the west boundary, there are only about 100 acres of uplands found on a narrow strip along the escarpment that separates the Mississippi Delta from the Coastal Plain.  The majority of the refuge is bottomland hardwood forest consisting primarily of willow and overcup oaks.   Willow oaks, found here in abundance, produce small acrons that are an excellent source of food for the mallards and wood ducks that make their winter home here.\n\n\n\nThroughout the refuge are a number of impoundments, where the water and the plants are managed to benefit wildlife living on the refuge, especially waterfowl.

Scattered along 50 miles of coastline in York and Cumberland counties, the refuge consists of ten divisions between Kittery and Cape Elizabeth.  It will contain approximately 7,600 acres when land acquisition is complete.\n\n\n\nOur namesake, Rachel Carson, was a world-renowned marine biologist, author and environmentalist.  She served as an aquatic\n\nbiologist and Editor-in-Chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  During her tenure, she composed a series\n\nof articles on Atlantic Coast wildlife refuges.  \n\n\n\nMs. Carson was born in Pennsylvania in 1907.  Though the mystery of the sea and its creatures captivated her at an early age, the Maine coast particularly inspired her.  Beginning in 1952, she summered on Southport Island, where she studied its beach and tide pools to research The Edge of the Sea (1955). \n\n\n\nThrough tireless investigation for her greatest work, Silent Spring (1962), she linked the unrestrained use of post-World War II chemical pesticides with fearsome, biological consequences.  Overcoming industry and government pressure to abandon her research, she persevered.  Carson simply and convincingly explained the connections between humans and all creatures of the Earth.  She alerted generations to use chemicals with\n\nutmost caution, warning that their improper use has dreadful effects on public health and the environment.  \n\n\n\nRachel Carson died in 1964, a victim of cancer.

Wood ducks abound here and the unit has a very healthy deer herd.  Peregrine falcon, bald eagles, merlin, least tern, black tern and wood stork occasionally pass through the refuge in migration. Eastern screech owls, barred owls, great-horned owls, loggerhead shrikes, and red-tailed hawks are common year-round residents.  Blue grosbeaks, dickcissels, and painted buntings can be seen during the summer months. Most of the agriculture land of the area is devoted to raising soybeans and rice, for the benefit of waterfowl.

Many of these birds breed and nest on the refuge. Others pass through on their way to breeding and nesting grounds elsewhere in the state. Migrants, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, raptors and songbirds, begin arriving in the valley in April, and continue into early June. An estimated 116 species breed on Tetlin during the short summer, when long days and warm temperatures accelerate the growth of plants, insects and other invertebrates, providing a ready source of rich foods for nesting birds.\n\n\n\nTetlin Refuge also supports a variety of large mammals. Dall sheep dot the higher slopes while moose feed upon the tender new growth that springs up in the wake of frequent lightning caused fires. Wolves, grizzly and black bears and members of three different caribou herds range over the refuge. \n\n\n\nTwo of the six known humpback whitefish spawning areas in the Yukon River drainage are located within the refuge.

The two refuges supply important feeding and resting habitat for migrating and wintering populations of waterfowl.  Established in 1980 and 1979, respectively, the 55,000 acre McFaddin NWR consists of the largest remaining freshwater marsh on the Texas Coast and thousands of acres of intermediate to brackish marsh, while neighboring Texas Point NWR encompasses 8,900 acres of fresh to salt marsh with some wooded uplands and prairie ridges. \n\n\n\nMcFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges are two of the 540 refuges that comprise the National Wildlife Refuge System, a national network of lands and waters set aside for the benefit of wildlife, and you!","RecAreaPhone":"409-971-2909","RecAreaEmail":"null","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-93.90111111,"RecAreaLatitude":29.70277778,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"P.O.

The refuge's saltmarshes, combined with the adjacent New York State-owned saltmarsh, form the largest continuous saltmarsh on Long Island. \n\n\n\nThe remaining half of the refuge is upland featuring the rare Pine Barren habitats of pitch pine, oak-pine, mixed oak, pioneer hardwood, upland shrub, and grasslands.  \n\n\n\nThe refuge's wildlife populations are quite diverse.  About 300 species of birds have been documented at Wertheim. The refuge winters up to 5,000 waterfowl, the majority being black ducks - a species in nationwide decline. The coastal location also makes this refuge an excellent migration corridor for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds. \n\n\n\nThe main purpose for establishing the refuge was to protect the Carmans River Estuary for migratory birds.

Located in the Willamette Valley, the refuge protects many of the valley's historic habitats, including the largest remaining tract of native Willamette Valley wet prairie. Fields of wildlife food crops are interspersed with Oregon white oak savannah, meandering creeks with bottomland Oregon ash forest, old growth big-leaf maple, and native prairie. \n\n\n\nOther management goals are to preserve native species and enhance biodiversity. Endangered and threatened species such as peregrine falcons, bald eagles, Oregon chub, and Bradshaw's desert parsley find protection and sanctuary on the refuge. A herd of Roosevelt elk can be found in the bottomland forests or farm fields on the refuge. \n\n\n\nOf historic interest is the Fiechter House, completed in 1857, and thought to be the oldest house in Benton County.

The landscape is dominated by intense, row-crop agriculture, which has led to the drainage of\n\nmost wetlands and widespread water quality problems. Deteriorating drainage tile systems and the abundance of\n\nhistoric wetland basins provide unlimited opportunities for wetland restorations. \n\n\n\nHeron Lake was once known as the \"Chesapeake Bay of the Midwest\" because of its tremendous canvasback migrations. This 6,400-acre, shallow, prairie lake suffers from over-enrichment due to agricultural run-off; high populations of rough fish; and loss of aquatic vegetation; all symptoms typical to area lakes. Heron Lake is the focus of a multi-partner effort to restore the lake and its 474-square-mile watershed. The Service is an active partner in this effort. \n\n\n\nThe ecosystem approach to management involves working closely with private landowners to restore degraded habitat.

Almost 70% of this 19 million acre refuge is below 100 feet in elevation, and consists of a broad, flat delta stitched through with rivers and streams and dotted with countless lakes, sloughs and ponds.  Bordering this expanse of tundra and wetlands are forest and shrub habitat and uplands sporting mountains more than 4000 feet high.  The refuge also includes two large islands - Nelson and Nunivak.\n\n\n\nThe Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is among the most populated rural areas in Alaska and within the refuge, 35 villages and nearly 25,000 Yup'ik Eskimo people make their home.  Along with this population comes a region rich in culture where residents dependent on resources to support an active subsistence way of life. \n\n\n\nA vision of the Yukon Delta Refuge is one of waterfowl.  Without question, the refuge supports one of the largest aggregations of water birds in the world and a spectacle takes place every spring as millions of ducks, geese, and other water birds return to the refuge to nest.  But a vision of the refuge must be much broader than waterfowl.  It supports one of the most important shorebird nesting areas in the United States in terms of both density and species diversity.  Hundreds of miles of rivers and streams provide spawning and rearing habitat for 44 species of fish including all five North American Pacific salmon.  Drier upland habitats harbor populations of both brown and black bears, caribou, moose, wolves, and muskox.  Along the coast of the refuge, the waters of the Bering Sea host a variety of marine mammals, including whales which pass during migration.","RecAreaPhone":"907-543-3151","RecAreaEmail":"yukondelta@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-161.7810059,"RecAreaLatitude":60.78779984,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"State Highway","address2":"Box 346","city":"Bethel","state":"AK","media":[{"title":"Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/04/15/02/1678_6d4828c5-6d7b-4d67-ae14-46057b2def7d_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Reserve-able campsite E176","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/17/59/1678_cc22c228-e3f6-42f9-be09-5d990b8477b3_700.jpg"},{"title":"Reserve-able campsite E176","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/17/58/1678_9c31e020-2243-418c-891a-420f7b4f56f4_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/04/15/02/1678_d94979cd-d20c-4066-aa38-0a46417c6edd_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://yukondelta.fws.gov"},{"RecAreaID":"1679","RecAreaName":"Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"The third largest conservation area in the National Wildlife Refuge System, the 9 million acre Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge is located in eastern interior Alaska. It includes the Yukon Flats, a vast wetland basin bisected by the Yukon River. The basin is underlain by permafrost and includes a complex network of lakes, streams, and rivers. The area is characterized by mixed forests dominated by spruce, birch, and aspen. The Yukon Flats has a continental subarctic climate, with great seasonal extremes in temperature and daylight. Summer temperatures can reach 100 degrees F, warmer than any other comparable latitude in North America. Winter temperatures can drop to -70 degrees F.\n\n\n\nThe refuge supports the highest density of breeding ducks in Alaska, and includes one of the greatest waterfowl breeding areas in North America. In fact, most of Yukon Flats' birds are seasonal residents, fleeing south before the hard grip of winter closes over the land. Some 13 species, however (including boreal chickadees, great gray owls, spruce grouse, three-toed woodpeckers and ravens), remain on the refuge year around.\n\n\n\nThe same landscape that so favors waterfowl is also beneficial to furbearers, many of which, including beaver, lynx, marten, mink, muskrat and river otter, thrive on the water-laced flood plain. Moose benefit from the new growth encouraged by fire and flood, and can be found throughout the refuge. These large ungulates are the region's most important game animal; to the point that, for many subsistence hunters living on or around the refuge, \"moose\" is virtually synonymous with \"meat.\"\n\n\n\nGrizzly bears are found throughout the refuge in low concentrations, while the more common black bears tend to keep to the forested lowlands. Wolves can also be encountered anywhere on the refuge, but are rarely sighted. Dall sheep can be spotted on the alpine tundra of the White Mountains and Hodzana Highlands.","RecAreaPhone":"907-456-0440","RecAreaEmail":"yukonflats@fws.gov ","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-147.7059937,"RecAreaLatitude":64.83850098,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"101 12th Ave","address2":"Box 264","city":"Fairbanks","state":"AK","media":[{"title":"Reserve-able campsite E177","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/18/02/1679_b2841b41-e224-4f9b-a636-e335378c63b2_700.jpg"},{"title":"Reserve-able campsite E177","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/09/15/18/03/1679_be6e0a19-fa97-4c9c-9ab2-f72f067742c5_1440.jpg"}],"website":"http://yukonflats.fws.gov"},{"RecAreaID":"16802","RecAreaName":"Gardner Mountain","RecAreaDescription":"The Gardner Mountain WSA encompasses 6,423 acres of public land with no state or private inholdings. <br><br> The area is generally rugged terrain of the southern Bighorn Mountains dominated by pine, scattered mountain mahogany, and meadows.

The mainstem of the river as well as Big and Little Indian Creeks, Fish Creek, the South Fork and the Little Blitzen River were originally designated in 1988. Several more tributaries were added to the river system in 2000, including portions of Mud and Ankle Creeks. Activities include hunting, fishing, camping backpacking, horse use and other outdoor pursuits. Four developed campgrounds at Page Springs, Fish Lake, Jackman Park and South Steens make great launch points for backcountry adventure  in the area’s wild and scenic rivers.\r\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\r\n<ul><li> \r\nCarry enough water and food to last your entire trip, and do not drink from untested water sources.\r\n</li><li> \r\nTicks, mosquitoes, and rattlesnakes in certain areas during spring and summer.\r\n</li><li> \r\nWeather conditions – the mountain’s high elevation can cause rapid temperature changes. Blustery, 100-degree days are common and snow can fall year-round. Be prepared for sudden lightning storms, snow, rain, and high winds.\r\n</li><li> \r\nLong distances between services – including gas stations, phones, and cell phone reception. Let someone at home know where you plan to go and when you plan to return. Phone service should not be relied on for emergency communication. Always start your trip with a full tank of fuel and call ahead for current information about fuel availability in the Steens Mountain area. Fuel may be available in the towns of Fields, Frenchglen, Crane, or the Narrows.\r\n</li><li> \r\nRough terrain – deep canyons and rocky slopes are a natural party of the rugged mountain territory. Elevation can change from less than 4,000 feet to over 9,000 feet over the course of a few miles traveled. We recommend high clearance or 4x4 vehicles for primitive roads, including the steep and rocky portion of the Steens Mountain Loop Road near South Steens Campground. The rest of the Steens Mountain Loop Road can accommodate passenger cars at lower speeds. High quality tires are a must for all vehicles, even when traveling on maintained routes.\r\n</li><li> \r\nLivestock and wildlife on roadways – much of southeast Oregon is open range. Be alert, drive with caution, and plan to share roadways with cattle, deer, elk, antelope, wild horses, and rabbits!\r\n</li><li>\r\nStaying Found – the remote nature and vast landscape of the Steens Mountain area may leave even the most experienced traveler directionally confused or just plain lost. Traveling with a current map of the area is essential! Don’t hesitate to talk to locals - area landowners and Federal employees are generally visible in the Steens Mountain area. We welcome your visit and have information to help you.\r\n</li><li>\r\nWhen recreating on public lands, practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.\r\n\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\r\nIn 1860, the U.S. Army sent Major Enoch Steen to determine the feasibility of a road from southeastern Oregon to the Willamette Valley. His party named many prominent topographic features, including Steens Mountain. In 1864, during a thunderstorm, Captain George B. Curry and his command were forced to cross a river on the west slope of the Steens. He named the River \"Donner und Blitzen,\" which is German for thunder and lightning.\r\n","RecAreaPhone":"541-573-4400","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_OR_BU_Mail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://flic.kr/p/21mqubS","RecAreaLongitude":-118.81474,"RecAreaLatitude":42.68529,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Burns District Office","address2":"28910 Hwy 20 West","city":"Hines","state":"OR","media":[{"title":"Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/84838.jpg"},{"title":"Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/84839.jpg"},{"title":"Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/84840.jpg"},{"title":"Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/images/84841.jpg"}],"website":"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington/donner-und-blitzen-wsr"},{"RecAreaID":"1705","RecAreaName":"Little Black Mountain Petroglyph Site","RecAreaDescription":"******* The state has leased land for a gravel pit within the main access road to Little Black Mountain Petroglyph Site.

It presides over mountainous terrain with deep, winding canyons, many with rich riparian vegetation fed by bubbling springs. The Sierra Nevada meets the Great Basin and the Mojave Desert here, creating an unusual ecosystem. You'll find creosote bush scrub communities on the bajadas; scattered yuccas, cactuses, flowering annuals, cottonwoods, and oaks in the canyons and valleys; and juniper and piñon woodlands with sagebrush and digger pines on the upper elevations.

Of special note is the fact that the Upper Missouri contains segments of all three river classifications contained in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968.  These classifications are Wild, Scenic and Recreational.  To this day the Upper Missouri remains relatively unchanged and its settings vary from riparian vegetation, to the unique and beautiful White Cliffs, to the sharply carved and rugged Badlands, to the rolling, pine and juniper covered slopes of the Breaks.  These contrasting habitats provide for a diverse and plentiful wildlife population, numerous recreational opportunities, livestock grazing and other multiple use activities.  Though the Upper Missouri lacks the stimulating whitewater runs much sought after by thrill seekers it more than makes up for the river runners fix with its mesmerizing glimpse of the American west as it once was.<p/><p>  For the family who plays together, the Upper Missouri caters to boaters of all degrees, from the beginning novice to the expert paddler to the leisurely motor boat aficionado.  Visitors embark into a capacious river corridor that seemingly swallows even the largest groups and are treated to a remoteness not often found in the 21st Century.  Optimum periods for boating are May through September with fishing and hunting use replacing leisure boating during the shoulder seasons.  Compared to other rivers in the Northwest visitation is relatively low with an annual average over the past ten years of about five thousand registered boaters during the boating season.  With 149 miles of river and several public launch points to choose from, trip lengths may vary from one day to ten days or more.  By far the most popular float, taking in the scenic White Cliffs, expends two nights with the takeout on the third day.  In this section, visitors will find developed boat camps with vault toilets, fire rings and superb hiking opportunities, not to mention the hauntingly beautiful, geographic splendor of the region.  For those with a few days to spare, an extension of this trip permits the adventurous sort to take in the even more remote and uniquely appealing, Breaks of the lower river section.  \r\n\t<p/><p>The contact point for any excursion on the Upper Missouri should begin by contacting the Lewistown Field Office or the Fort Benton River Management Station, co-located with the Upper Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center on the north bank of the river in Fort Benton, Montana. <p/><p> The staff at this first rate facility can provide a wealth of information on the Monuments varied recreational opportunities, as well as other significant cultural, and historical sites in the surrounding area.

Lake Powell is part of the <A HREF=\"http://www.nps.gov/glca\">Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</a>.The Bureau of Reclamation started construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1956 and Lake Powell started filling on March 13, 1963. In 1980, 17 years after the diversion tunnel gates were closed, Lake Powell filled completely. Today, over 20 million people depend on the waters of Lake Powell to sustain life.The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established in 1972 and is operated by the <A HREF=\"http://www.nps.gov\">National Park Service</a>. Visitors to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area number about 2.4 million annually. The Hole in the Rock, Crossing of the Fathers, and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are all publicly-accessible historic sites steeped in western frontier and environmental history.  However, all are reached on the lake by boat.  The Carl Hayden Visitor Center, named after the late Arizona Senator, contains exhibits that focus on the history of the dam and Glen Canyon. With its hundreds of miles of shoreline, Lake Powell affords opportunities for hiking, camping, swimming, boating, and fishing. Although all types of water sports are popular, boating and fishing are the prime attractions. Lake Powell, which offers some of the nation's finest fishing, contains bass, bluegill, green sunfish, walleye, black crappie, northern pike, and catfish. In the river below the dam, the clear, cold waters released from the depths of Lake Powell create a perfect habitat for trout. The blue-ribbon fishery, which was developed after the dam was built, supports trophy-sized trout in the 15-mile reach of river to Lees Ferry.  <A HREF=\"https://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/basin/index.html\"> Current reservoir levels.</a>","RecAreaPhone":"928-608-6404","RecAreaEmail":"lakepleasant@mail.maricopa.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/crsp.html","RecAreaLongitude":-111.49493,"RecAreaLatitude":36.93997,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Glen Canyon National Recreation Area","address2":"","city":"Page","state":"AZ","media":[{"title":"South Sister Climber's Trail, Moraine Lake, Devil's Lake, South Sister, Wickiup Plain, Green Lakes","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2020/03/27/17/33/2002_d1666b2a-332f-4c3a-8dd9-fd00bfff06c3_700.jpg"},{"title":"South Sister Climber's Trail, Moraine Lake, Devil's Lake, South Sister, Wickiup Plain, Green Lakes","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2020/03/27/17/33/2002_25986d37-c229-4b11-8f0d-b53539679d7b_700.jpg"},{"title":"South Sister Climber's Trail, Moraine Lake, Devil's Lake, South Sister, Wickiup Plain, Green Lakes","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2020/03/27/17/31/2002_3c2f80ff-a844-49c8-9842-3fd03a116bca_1440.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.nps.gov/glca/index.htm"},{"RecAreaID":"2005","RecAreaName":"Dakota Prairie National Grasslands","RecAreaDescription":"<h3>Some tips to help you enjoy your recreation experience...</h3>\r\r<ul>\r\t<li><strong>Fireworks</strong> are not allowed on the Grasslands.</li>\r\t<li>Winter brings snow and extreme temperatures.

These lands hold a spectacular array of plant life, wildlife, unique geological features, endless recreational opportunities, and significant historical and cultural values. The rugged landscape has retained much of its unspoiled character over the centuries and, as a result, offers outstanding opportunities for solitude and dispersed recreation. In some areas, the BLM lands are intermingled with State of Montana lands and private property. The monument designation applies only to the BLM-managed lands.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>The land and the rugged, surrounding uplands (commonly call the Missouri Breaks) are defined in part by their history. The entire region was the homeland and lifeblood of American Indians. The river served as the pathway for Lewis and Clark, then the waterway for steamboats and an attraction for fur trappers and traders. Later, the river and the Missouri Breaks were sanctuaries for desperados trying to stay a step ahead of the law. The land was also a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the public lands in the monument make a significant contribution to the local lifestyle and the regional economy. Within the monument, you can float the river, fish, hike, hunt, drive for pleasure, find a little solitude, enjoy a sense of exploration, or simply marvel at the variety of resources around you. If you cannot float the Upper Missouri or visit the backcountry, you'll still be able to experience the cultural and natural history.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>Vast portions of the monument are serviced only by graveled and unimproved roads. Much of the monument is not accessible by any road, inviting visitors to explore on foot. Some of the roads are not suitable for low-clearance vehicles, and many roads cross soils that become absolutely impassable when wet. Off-road driving (cross-country travel) is not allowed in the monument. <p/>\r\n\r\n","RecAreaPhone":"406-538-1900","RecAreaEmail":"MT_Lewistown_FO@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.mt.blm.gov/ldo/monumentmap.htm","RecAreaLongitude":-110.6678,"RecAreaLatitude":47.8188,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center","address2":"701 7th Street","city":"Fort Benton","state":"MT","media":[{"title":"Picture of campsite with picnic table","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/24/16/54/3117_d08ca0a6-060f-4fd9-9907-edef80f6ca72_1440.jpg"},{"title":"Picture of campsite with picnic table","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2018/10/24/16/54/3117_01221e35-9cfd-41b3-b4f0-81119ddd9a83_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.blm.gov/mt/st/en/fo/lewistown_field_office/umrbnm.html"},{"RecAreaID":"3119","RecAreaName":"Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument","RecAreaDescription":"The Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument was created to protect an array of biological, geological, \r\n                                       hydrological, archeological and historic resources.

The primary purpose for the designation is to protect and enhance the desert riparian ecosystem, a rare remnant of what was once an extensive network of similar riparian systems throughout the Southwest. <br/><br/> Many recreational opportunities are available within the NCA.  Three of the most popular sites are :  <br/><br/>\t <strong>Murray Springs Clovis Site,</strong>  a significant archaeological site that contains an undisturbed stratigraphic record of the past 40,000 years. Excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona  from 1966 to 1971. People first arrived in this area 11,000 years ago. They belonged to what  we now call the Clovis Culture and were the earliest known people to have inhabited North America. Named after the distinctive and beautifully crafted Clovis spear points they made, they were expert hunters of the large mammals of the last Ice Age. An interpretive trail leads visitors through the site. From Sierra Vista, take Arizona Route 90 east 6 miles to Monson Road. Turn left, and go about 1.2 miles to the signed turnoff to Murray Springs. The access road is located on the right.  \t<br/><br/> <strong>The Spanish Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate</strong> is the most intact remaining example of a once-extensive network of similar presidios. These fortresses marked the northern extension of New Spain into the New World. Only a stone foundation and a few remaining adobe wall remnants mark the location of an isolated and dangerous military station.  From Fairbank on Arizona Route 82, drive approximately 2 miles west on Route 82, turn right on the Kellar Ranch Road and travel approximately 3 miles to the trailhead.   Hike about 2 miles to the ruins and interpretive displays. \t<br/><br/><strong>The San Pedro House</strong>, located 9 miles east of Sierra Vista on Arizona Route 90, is a popular trailhead for birdwatchers, hikers, and mountain bikers.  The Friends of San Pedro operate a bookstore and information center.","RecAreaPhone":"(520) 258-7200","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_AZ_TFOWEB@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/AZ_SanPedroRiparian_NCA_map.pdf","RecAreaLongitude":-110.10198,"RecAreaLatitude":31.37953,"lastUpdated":"2020-04-14","address1":"4070 South Avenida Saracino","address2":"","city":"Sierra Vista","state":"AZ","media":[{"title":"Parking Pad","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/11/23/21/51/595_a626f621-1d80-4173-9ec7-2d9b304db11a_700.jpg"},{"title":"Site 135","url":"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2019/11/23/21/50/595_5a8e023d-3a0f-4f5b-94c3-2c574b21c990_700.jpg"}],"website":"http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/ncarea/sprnca.html"},{"RecAreaID":"596","RecAreaName":"La Posa Long Term Visitor Area","RecAreaDescription":"<h2>COVID-19 FACILITY UPDATES</h2><p>Facilities or services have changed at this site in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). <strong><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/alert/az-covid-19-updates\">Click here for updates.</a></strong></p><h2>Overview</h2>The La Posa Long Term Visitor Area (LTVA) was created in 1983 to fulfill the needs of winter visitors and to protect the local desert ecosystem from overuse.

Gold panning and prospecting have never fallen out of favor since the 1850’s when this canyon had a large mining population.  In autumn the crowds subside and the Merced River Recreation Area provides more solitude while still offering most of the appeal and activities as earlier in the year.  By winter, true solitude can be found.  The weather is usually quite warm and sunny between storms.  Daytime highs in the 60’s and overnight lows in the 30’s are common.\r\n<p>While some activities are best in specific seasons, there are many things to do all year long.  Bird watching is good throughout the area most of the year.  Fishing is popular for trout and bass along the entire river.  Biking along the gravel roads and trails is popular with families and experienced mountain bikers alike.  Hiking is great anytime of the year.<p>The Merced River Trail continues on downstream from the end of the Briceburg River Road and brings hikers or bikers to the North Fork of the Merced and beyond.  The Burma Grade is another popular route to explore on foot, bike, or high-clearance automobile.  This scenic backroad climbs steeply out of the Merced Canyon and eventually leads to Greely Hill or Buck Meadows (Highway 120).\r\n<p><h2>Special Guidelines for Merced River Recreation Area Campgrounds During COVID-19</h2><p>\r\nIn order to comply with the <a href=https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds.pdf> Mariposa County Interim Guidelines for Campgrounds</a>, the following procedures are put in place: <p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Be prepared</strong> by bringing your own personal hygiene supplies, including <strong>soap, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Only<strong> one household per camp site </strong>(Maximum 8 persons).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Only registered campers in developed campgrounds.</strong> McCabe Beach is for registered campers only during COVID-19 restrictions. <em>(First come first served, on-site registration/payment only—no advanced registration).</li></em>\r\n<li><strong>No group campsites.</strong>  Site #13 will only allow 8 persons.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stay home</strong> if you are sick.</li></ul><p>\r\n\r\nPlease help keep these campgrounds open by adhering to these guidelines.

The Red Hills are noticeably different from the surrounding countryside. The serpentine-based soils in the area support a unique assemblage of plant species. Included among the thorny buckbrush and foothill pine is a rich variety of annual wildflowers, which put on a showy display every spring. <P> In the Red Hills buckbrush and other shrubs provide browse and seeds for small populations of mammals, including mule deer, jackrabbits, rodents. Coyotes, bobcats and fox can also be found in the Red Hills. Approximately 88 bird species have been observed in the Red Hills. Some common species include mourning dove, acorn woodpecker, ash-throated flycatcher, scrub jay, wrentit, plain titmouse, bushtit, Bewick's wren, and house finch. Valley quail and mourning doves are the major game birds in the Red Hills. An abundant insect population supports insectivorous birds including western kingbirds, ash- throated flycatcher, tree swallows, barn swallows, black phoebes, and others. Raptors include the red-tailed hawk, Cooper's hawk, prairie falcon, and great horned owl. Fish-eating birds seen in the Red Hills include the belted kingfisher and great blue heron. Roadrunners can also be found. <P> Four sensitive species of animals are known from the Red Hills. Wintering bald eagles roost along the shores of Don Pedro Reservoir and have been observed where Six Bit Gulch enters the lake.

These three groups are working together to conserve and enhance the unique ecosystems found here and to protect endangered species, as well as the areas they depend upon. The mosaic of public and private land, which includes the BLM's <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/search-details/2276/2\">Redfield Canyon Wilderness</a>, the U.S. Forest Service's Galiuro Wilderness, and The Nature Conservancy's Muleshoe Preserve, offers a diversity of remote recreational opportunities.<br/><br/>Within the Muleshoe is found most of the watershed area for seven permanently flowing streams, representing some of the best remaining aquatic habitat in Arizona. Some 80% of the region's wildlife species depend upon these streamside communities at some time in their lives. The importance of this area to early settlers is seen in the numerous ranches and homesteads that dotted the area in the last 150 years. They were also critically dependent upon the riparian communities for their survival in such a rigorous landscape.<br/><br/>The Muleshoe provides everyone with the opportunity to learn more about southeastern Arizona's rich natural and cultural history. This area boasts rugged mountains, canyon streams, saguaro cactus, and mesquite bosques that are home to desert dwellers such as Coatimundi, Javelina, and a wide variety of neo-tropical migratory birds and native fish.
